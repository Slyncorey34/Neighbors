			<p>The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. We the best. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there</p>
